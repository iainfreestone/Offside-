    <h2>🆕 Your First Time as Linesman — What to Expect</h2>
    <p class="article-intro">
        It's Saturday morning. You're standing on a muddy touchline clutching a flag you've never held before,
        while 22 kids sprint around a pitch. The referee has asked you to "just watch for offside."
        <strong>Sound familiar?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're a parent who's been roped into running the line at your child's grassroots football match,
        you're not alone. Thousands of mums and dads across the country do this every weekend — and almost
        all of them were nervous the first time.
    </p>

    <h3>It's OK to Be Nervous</h3>
    <p>
        Nobody expects you to be a Premier League assistant referee. At grassroots level, the standard is simply
        <strong>do your best</strong>. The referee knows you're a volunteer parent. The coaches know it. Even
        the kids know it. A few mistakes are absolutely fine — professional officials with VAR technology still
        get calls wrong!
    </p>

    <h3>What You Actually Need to Do</h3>
    <p>
        Your main job as a parent linesman (technically called a "club assistant referee") is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Indicate which team gets the throw-in</strong> when the ball goes out of play on your side</li>
        <li><strong>Flag for offside</strong> when you see it (this is the one that worries everyone)</li>
        <li>Optionally help the referee spot fouls or incidents they might have missed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That's it. You don't need to know every rule in the book. You just need to understand the offside rule
        and know which direction each team is playing.
    </p>

    <h3>Three Things That Help</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Position yourself in line with the second-last defender</strong> — this gives you the best view
            for offside decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Watch the moment the ball is kicked</strong>, not where it ends up — offside is judged at the
            instant of the pass</li>
        <li><strong>If in doubt, keep your flag down</strong> — benefit of the doubt always goes to the attacker</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
    <p>
        The best thing you can do before your first match is spend 5–10 minutes understanding the offside rule
        and practising a few decisions. You don't need to study the entire FA rulebook — just the basics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our <a href="../#interactive" class="guide-link">interactive 3D trainer</a> lets you practise real match
        scenarios from the linesman's view. Start on Easy difficulty — it walks you through each decision.
        After 5 minutes, you'll feel significantly more confident.

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>💡 Top tip:</strong> Arrive 10 minutes early and have a quick word with the referee. Ask which
        half you're covering and whether they want you to flag anything specific. It takes the pressure off
        and shows you're taking it seriously.
    </div>

    <h3>What About the Other Parents?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, some parents on the opposing team might shout if they disagree with your decisions. It happens.
        The best response is no response — just carry on. Remember: <strong>you're the one who volunteered</strong>.
        You're doing the kids a favour so the match can go ahead properly. That's what matters.
    </p>

    <h3>After the Match</h3>
    <p>
        However it goes, you'll feel a huge sense of relief — and probably find it wasn't as bad as you expected.
        Most parents who try it once end up doing it again. Some even go on to take the
        <a href="https://www.thefa.com/get-involved/referee" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="guide-link">FA
            Referee course</a>
        when they realise they quite enjoy it!
