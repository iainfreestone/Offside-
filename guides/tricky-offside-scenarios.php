    <h2>🧩 5 Tricky Offside Scenarios That Catch Everyone Out</h2>
    <p class="article-intro">
        Think you've got the offside rule nailed? These real-match situations trip up even experienced assistants.
        Understanding these will put you ahead of 90% of parent linesmen.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The Deflection vs Deliberate Play</h3>
    <p>
        An attacker plays the ball forward. It hits a defender and bounces to another attacker who was in an
        offside position. Is it offside?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Yes!</strong> A deflection off a defender does <strong>not</strong> reset the offside situation.
        Only a <strong>deliberate play</strong> by the defender — where they had control and chose to kick, head,
        or pass the ball — resets it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is one of the trickiest distinctions in the game. The key question is: did the defender <em>intend</em>
        to play the ball, or did it just hit them? If the ball ricochets off a defender's leg while they're running,
        that's a deflection (offside stands). If the defender swings a foot to clear the ball and miskicks it,
        that's a deliberate play (offside resets).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: a <strong>deliberate save</strong> (goalkeeper or outfield player blocking a shot on goal) does
        <strong>not</strong> reset offside either. Only a deliberate <em>play</em> — not a save — counts.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The Goalkeeper Goes Walkabout</h3>
    <p>
        Late in a match, the goalkeeper comes up for a corner. On the counter-attack, only one defender is back.
        An attacker is behind that defender but <strong>ahead of the stranded goalkeeper</strong> who's still
        running back.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>This is offside.</strong> The rule refers to the "second-last opponent." Normally the GK is
        the last and a defender is the second-last. But with the GK pushed up, the GK might now be the
        second-last — and the attacker needs to be behind <em>them</em> to be onside.
    </p>
    <p>
        This scenario is unusual at grassroots kids' football, but it does happen — especially in older age
        groups where teams push for a late equaliser.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Offside Position But Not Interfering</h3>
    <p>
        Two attackers make runs. One is clearly offside, the other is onside. The ball goes to the onside player.
        The offside player jogs away without being involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Not offside.</strong> Being in an offside <em>position</em> is not an offence. The player has to
        become actively involved by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interfering with play</strong> — touching or playing the ball</li>
        <li><strong>Interfering with an opponent</strong> — blocking their view, challenging them, or clearly
            impacting their ability to play the ball</li>
        <li><strong>Gaining an advantage</strong> — receiving the ball after it rebounds off the post, crossbar,
            or an opponent when they wouldn't have been able to reach it otherwise</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the offside player is standing on the far side of the pitch doing nothing, play on. But if they're
        near the goalkeeper and blocking their view of the shot — that's offside even if they don't touch the ball.
    </p>

    <h3>4. The Attacker Who Runs Back</h3>
    <p>
        An attacker is in an offside position when the ball is played. They then run backwards to collect the ball
        in their own half.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>This is offside.</strong> What matters is their position at the <strong>moment of the pass</strong>,
        not where they receive the ball. Running back doesn't undo being offside.
    </p>
    <p>
        This catches a lot of people out because it <em>looks</em> fine — the player receives the ball in a
        perfectly legal position. But the moment that matters is the frame when the team-mate kicks the ball,
        and at that instant, the player was offside.
    </p>

    <h3>5. The Shoulder vs The Arm</h3>
    <p>
        An attacker's arm is slightly past the last defender, but their shoulder and body are level.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Not offside.</strong> Arms and hands don't count for offside. Only the head, body, and feet are
        considered. The IFAB (the body that writes the laws of football) defines the arm boundary as the bottom
        of the armpit — anything below that is "arm" and is ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        In professional football, VAR draws offside lines from the shoulder/armpit, never from the hand or
        forearm. At grassroots level, if you can see the player's body is level, they're onside — even if
        their arm is waving ahead of the defender.
