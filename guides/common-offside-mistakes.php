    <h2>⚠️ 7 Common Offside Mistakes New Linesmen Make</h2>
    <p class="article-intro">
        Even experienced parents get caught out by these. Here are the most common mistakes — and how to avoid them.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Flagging Offside From a Throw-In</h3>
    <p>
        This is the number one mistake. A player <strong>cannot be offside</strong> when receiving the ball directly
        from a throw-in. It doesn't matter if the attacker is standing on the goal line — if it's a throw-in,
        keep your flag down. The same applies to <strong>goal kicks</strong> and <strong>corner kicks</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why does this catch people out? Because it <em>looks</em> offside. A player in a seemingly impossible
        position receives the ball and it feels wrong. But the rule is clear — these three restarts are explicit
        exceptions.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Forgetting That "Level Is Onside"</h3>
    <p>
        If the attacker is exactly in line with the second-last opponent, they are <strong>onside</strong>.
        Many new linesmen flag this as offside because it "looks close." Remember: level always favours the
        attacker. When in doubt on a tight call, the flag stays down.
    </p>
    <p>
        At grassroots level, the players are moving quickly and you don't have VAR. If you can't be certain,
        the player is onside. Simple.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Watching the Ball Instead of the Players</h3>
    <p>
        This is the hardest habit to break. When a pass is made, your natural instinct is to follow the ball.
        But offside is judged at the <strong>moment the ball is played</strong> — you need to be watching the
        defensive line and the attacker's position at that instant.
    </p>
    <p>
        Try using a <strong>"mental snapshot" technique</strong>: freeze the picture in your mind at the moment
        of the kick. Where was the second-last defender? Where was the attacker? That snapshot is your decision.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Not Knowing About the Goalkeeper</h3>
    <p>
        The offside rule talks about the "second-last opponent" — not the "last defender." The goalkeeper usually
        counts as the last opponent, making the last outfield defender the second-last. But if the
        <strong>goalkeeper comes forward</strong> (e.g., for a corner), the GK might become the second-last
        opponent, and attackers who thought they were behind the last defender could actually be offside.
    </p>
    <p>
        This situation is rare at grassroots level, but when it happens, it catches everyone out. Read more
        about it in our <a href="tricky-offside-scenarios" class="guide-link">tricky scenarios guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Flagging Immediately Instead of Waiting</h3>
    <p>
        At professional level, assistant referees use a technique called <strong>"wait and see"</strong>. If a
        player is in an offside position but doesn't touch the ball or interfere with play, there's no offence.
        Being in an offside <em>position</em> alone is not illegal — the player has to become <strong>actively
            involved</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wait until they touch the ball or clearly impact an opponent before raising your flag. This avoids
        the embarrassing situation of flagging someone offside who then jogs away from the play entirely.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Ignoring the "Behind the Ball" Rule</h3>
    <p>
        A player is only offside if they're nearer to the goal line than <strong>both the ball and the
            second-last opponent</strong>. If the attacker is behind the ball when it's played, they cannot be
        offside — even if they're past every defender on the pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
        This often happens with through balls played from deep positions, or when an attacker receives a
        back-pass. If they were behind the ball at the moment it was kicked, no offside.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Standing in the Wrong Position</h3>
    <p>
        If you're not in line with the second-last defender, you simply cannot judge offside accurately.
        You need to be looking straight across the pitch along the offside line. If you're behind or ahead
        of it, the angle makes everything look different.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Keep moving</strong> — stay level with the second-last defender at all times. This is your
        single most important job as a linesman. Position determines accuracy.
