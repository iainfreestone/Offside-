    <!-- SEO content: What is the offside rule -->
    <div class="home-seo">
        <h3>What Is the Offside Rule in Football?</h3>
        <p>
            The offside rule is one of the most misunderstood laws in football — but it's actually simpler than most
            people think.
            A player is in an <strong>offside position</strong> if, at the moment the ball is played by a team-mate,
            they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the <strong>opponents' half</strong> of the pitch</li>
            <li>Nearer to the opponents' goal line than both the <strong>ball</strong> and the <strong>second-last
                    opponent</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Being in an offside position isn't itself an offence. It only becomes one when the player <strong>actively
                gets involved</strong> — by playing the ball, interfering with an opponent, or gaining an advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three important exceptions: a player <strong>cannot be offside</strong> when receiving the ball
            directly from
            a <strong>throw-in</strong>, <strong>goal kick</strong>, or <strong>corner kick</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the golden rule that helps attackers: if a player is exactly <strong>level with the second-last
                opponent</strong>,
            they are <strong>onside</strong>. Level always favours the attacker.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Was This Site Built?</h3>
        <p>
            Every weekend across the UK, parents are handed a flag and asked to run the line at their child's grassroots
            football match. Most have never done it before. Many don't fully understand the offside rule. Almost all of
            them are nervous.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site was built specifically for those parents. Not for referees, not for coaches, not for football
            experts — for <strong>mums and dads standing on a muddy touchline</strong> wondering what they've got
            themselves into. Everything here is written in plain English, with no jargon and no assumptions about
            prior knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our <strong>interactive 3D trainer</strong> is the centrepiece — it lets you practise real match scenarios
            from the linesman's camera angle, so you can experience the decisions you'll face on Saturday morning.
            It's free, requires no sign-up, and works on any device.
