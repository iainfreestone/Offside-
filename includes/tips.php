        <h3>🏃 Positioning</h3>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">1</span><span>Stay <strong>in line with the second-last defender</strong> at all
                times. This is your most important job — if you're out of position,
                you can't make the call.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">2</span><span>Move up and down the touchline, keeping pace with play. Watch the
                defenders, not just the ball.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">3</span><span>Stand side-on so you can see both the ball and the defensive line
                in your peripheral vision.</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>👀 What to Watch</h3>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">4</span><span><strong>Watch the moment the ball is kicked</strong>, not where it
                ends up. Offside is judged at the instant of the pass, not when the
                ball arrives.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">5</span><span>Focus on the defensive line and the attacker's position relative to
                it. Use a "mental snapshot" at the moment of the pass.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">6</span><span>For kids' football, don't worry about getting it perfect. Do your
                best — even professional assistants get help from VAR!</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>🚩 Flag Technique</h3>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">7</span><span>Hold the flag in the hand
                <strong>nearest the referee</strong> (switch hands at half-time when
                you change ends).</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">8</span><span>For offside: <strong>raise the flag straight up</strong>, wait for
                the referee's whistle, then point to where the offence occurred
                (near side, centre, or far side).</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">9</span><span>Keep the flag <strong>unfurled and visible</strong>. Don't let it
                wrap around the stick.</span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>⚖️ When in Doubt</h3>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">10</span><span><strong>If in doubt, keep your flag down.</strong> "Benefit of the
                doubt to the attacker" is the standard approach. It's far better to
                miss a marginal offside than to wrongly flag a goal-scoring
                chance.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">11</span><span>Remember: the referee can overrule you. They have the final say.
                Don't argue — just carry on.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip-item">
            <span class="tip-number">12</span><span>Stay calm. Parents on the other side may disagree — that's part of
                the job! A friendly smile goes a long way.</span>
        </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h3>📋 Quick Reminders</h3>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>NOT offside from:</strong> Throw-ins, goal kicks, and corner
            kicks. If the ball comes directly from one of these, you cannot be
            offside.
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Level is onside:</strong> If the attacker is exactly level
            with the second-last defender, they are ONSIDE.
        </div>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Own half = safe:</strong> A player in their own half of the
            pitch cannot be offside, no matter where the defenders are.
